# Buruma

Buruma is a [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) theme built with the CSS framework [Bulma](https://bulma.io).

I am still working in the release of the first version (0.1.0). You can check the [0.1.0 milestone](https://github.com/ivanhercaz/buruma/milestone/1) done to track this version.

**Buruma is not ready for production!** The current version of Buruma is [0.1.0-alpha](https://github.com/ivanhercaz/buruma/releases/tag/0.1.0-alpha). I don't know if I will release different alpha versions during the process of development or if I will release an stable version (0.1.0). Anyway you can check the [releases](https://github.com/ivanhercaz/buruma/releases) to be sure that 0.1.0-alpha is the latest release or you can clone this repository.
